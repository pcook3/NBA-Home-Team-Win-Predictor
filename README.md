OVERVIEW: This project aims to predict the outcome of NBA games — specifically whether the home team wins — using historical game data and engineered features that capture team performance, rest differentials, and other key metrics.
The current phase of the project focuses on data preparation and feature engineering, laying the groundwork for accurate and interpretable machine learning models.

The cleanse.py file handles 100% of the merging and organizing of our imported NBA historic datasets.
The main.py file handles all model performance using the merged dataframe created by the cleanse.py file.
